                    <h3>Brief Project Description</h3>
                    <p>
                      For this project, we will be creating a website for the Arcadian Film Festival to celebrate a fusion of classical civilizations and contemporary cinema. This will serve as a hub for filmmakers, enthusiasts, and industry professionals to engage, share and explore multiple genres through the lens of film.<br><br>
                      The client’s primary goal is to have a website that filmmakers can use to submit/promote their films while also allowing film enthusiasts and industry professionals a way to experience these films.<br><br>
                      The scope of this project consists of the creation of a user-friendly website interface that is responsive across all devices, the creation of an extensive archive section featuring past festival events, film screenings, discussions and award winners and finally interactive features for film submission (along with information for film submission), award voting and community engagement to boost user participation and provide a unique and lasting user experience.
                    </p>

                      <h3> Audits of Existing Websites</h3>
                      <h4><a href="https://www.tiff.net/">Toronro Film Festival</a></h4>
                      <p>
                        To start off the Toronto Film Festival has good SEO, running the website through SEO audits yields results of B. The website has excellent On-Page SEO allowing search engines to almost always make sure it’s the first website up when you type in keywords such as “film”, “film festival”, “Canada film festival”, “toronto film” and even “toronto festival”. The links are all functional with next to no dead links, the only way to improve them is to make them more human and Search Engine readable.<br><br>

                        However, a big issue is the total page file size. The page is very media heavy with videos playing in the background while also being filled with images which ends up meaning it runs a bit slower on dated machines and slower internet connections. Due to this when resizing the window the website takes a bit to resize the website content.<br><br>

                        The only glaring issue is the lack of an obvious call to action for Film Submission, this may be due to the fact that the festival is over and they are preparing for their 2024 festival; however, some information for future submissions and an easy way to access it would be very useful. To get to submissions I had to google tiff submissions due to the fact I couldn’t find it on the homepage so this is definitely something that needs to be improved.<br><br>

                        Overall, the website is great with a consistent theme and no inconsistencies with heading tags or typography. Everything has a good hierarchy and it is completely responsive so it works on all devices. 
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <h4><a href="https://www.atlantafilmfestival.com/georgia">Atlanta Film Festival</a></h4>
                      <p>
                        We’ll be focusing on the films section of the website. The films section provides an interactive search filter that allows users to search for a title of a film, details about a film, or credits about a film. Users are able to click the buttons within the filter and the films will filter to its results.<br><br>

                        Of course, this isn’t the best filter system they’ve created. The filters provided are a mix of genres, film makers, and the type of film it is (e.g. short film, animation, episodic, etc). It makes it difficult to glance at the filter and pick out which one sounds the most interesting to us. The colors also clash with each other and make everything more overwhelming.<br><br>

                        The way the films are organized on that page is very pleasant. With a portrait image as the movie poster for each film, it makes it more engaging to the page and provides the more authentic feeling of movies and films. However, the movie text on top of the image creates a distraction that takes away attention from the movie poster.<br><br>

                      Page content will consist of a diverse selection of short films which are sourced through our received submissions from filmmakers and any collaborations with other film festivals.<br><br>

                      We will also have comprehensive listings for film screenings, discussions, workshops and other related events which we will update regularly to ensure accuracy and relevance.<br><br>

                      The creation of engaging content such as articles, interviews, reviews and behind-the-scene features will be sourced through collaboration with film critics, historians, and industry professionals willing to provide educated and insightful perspectives.<br><br>

                      Content such as reviews, comments and discussions will also be user-generated to foster community engagement and participation.<br><br>

                      Finally we will also make sure to integrate social media platforms to share festival updates, highlight featured films and to engage with our audience across several social media platforms. This will also help maximize the reach and visibility.

                      Research will be conducted to find relevant terms and phrases which can be used as keywords throughout the website for the most optimisation.<br><br>

                      Website content will be optimized by including target keywords not only within the keywords but also in the meta tags, headings and image alt attributes - this will help boost On-Page SEO.<br><br>

                      There will be a focus on creating relevant content so ensuring that the content is well-written and engaging for our target audience.<br><br>

                      Making sure the website is fully responsive across all platforms by using responsive design. By making the website mobile-friendly we can improve user experience and search rankings.<br><br>

                      Finally, implementing local SEO by including location-specific keywords such as Arcadia, Greece and Rome.<br><br>

                      Using Google Analytics to look at our website analytics and also using tools such as Google My Business for local listings and reviews.

                      After the successful creation of the Short Film Festival website, our commitment extends beyond its launch to ensure ongoing support and maintenance. With a focus on reliability and efficiency, our team will utilize GitHub domain hosting, aligning with our preferred platform for website deployment. This choice ensures seamless integration and facilitates swift updates whenever necessary. Ideally the website will update biannually for before and after the festival.

                      Hosting on github will restrict in-depth levels of customization. Other than further customization, github hosting seems safe, low-cost, maintainable, and relatively easy-to-use. In the event of github going down, we run the risk of our own website going down as well. If this becomes a problem we can migrate to a different hosting service.
